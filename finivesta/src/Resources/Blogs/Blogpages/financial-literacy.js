                        <li> Debt Management: Knowing how to manage debt responsibly is crucial for maintaining financial health. This includes understanding interest rates, repayment terms, and strategies for paying off debt efficiently. Financial literacy empowers individuals to avoid high-interest debt traps and maintain a good credit score.</li>
                        <li> Financial Planning: Effective financial planning involves setting realistic goals, creating a strategy to achieve them, and regularly reviewing and adjusting plans as circumstances change. It includes aspects like retirement planning, education funding, and emergency savings.</li>  
                        <li> Economic Awareness: Financial literacy extends to understanding broader economic concepts and how economic factors can influence personal finances. Awareness of economic trends, inflation, interest rates, and global economic events can help individuals make strategic financial decisions and manage risks effectively.</li>
                    </ul>
